###PowerRevUp

PowerRevUp is a program which will take a file(s) and increase the letter revision. 
To use PowerRevUp, select one or more files in file explorer and select 'PowerRevUp' in the right click menu.

If PowerRevUp does not appear in the right click menu, open the PowerRevUp.exe file in the PowerRevUp folder under GPA Apps. 
This will relaunch the program as an administrator, allowing the registry to be edited to include PowerRevUp in the right click menu.

PowerRevUp can move the revised files to another directory, if a user selects a folder for these to be moved to. This is done in the folder prompt which opens when the app is opened through the right click menu.

Because selecting multiple files in the context menu typically would open several instances of a program (rather than passing all of the files as command line arguments),
PowerRevUp will automatically record each of the file locations in .txt files. These files are then read by the first instance of PowerRevUp, allowing a single instance
of the application to handle multiple files.
